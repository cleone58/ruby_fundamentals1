#QUESTION NUMBER 1  How would you calculate a good tip for 55 dollar meal?

#CONST

TIP =0.15

#MEAL PRICE

  mealprice = 55

total = mealprice + (mealprice * TIP)


  puts "total price of meal including gratuity is #{total}"


puts "I have " + 9.to_s + " lives "

#String Interpolation

puts "45628 mulitplied by 7839 is equal to: #{45628 * 7839}  This was used via string interpolation"


#Is it True of False?

puts (10 < 20 && 30 < 20) || !(10 == 11)
